# my-first-task
~~Hello everyone~~,i am bilal zaro...
 today i created a **wireframe,mockup** 
  and a **prototype**
    for my *website*, focuses on a school academy system located in Zarqa, founded in 1988. At first, I faced some difficulties because I missed the last two lectures at the academy. However, I challenged myself and continued working on the project anyway.

For the design, I used some images I found on Google (which were not originally mine) and added icons to make the website look modern and fresh. I also created several triangles and lines for a more dynamic look. While writing content, I used some made-up information, such as the contact details, to complete the design.
---
I'm struggling to keep coming up with words for my introduction, as I'm really tired and need to sleep. But I hope you like my work, and thank you.
